Description: An implementation of selenium standalone server
 The Selenium Server is needed in order to run either Selenium RC style 
 scripts or Remote Selenium Webdriver ones. The 2.x server is a drop-in 
 replacement for the old Selenium RC server and is designed to be 
 backwards compatible with your existing infrastructure.
